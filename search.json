    "text": "Abstract\nAfrican elephants face severe threats from poaching and the loss of their natural habitats. Despite global attention towards their conservation, there is considerable uncertainty surrounding the population sizes and trends of elephants across much of Africa. Timely and accurate data on elephant populations is crucial for effective conservation efforts.\nA continent-wide survey conducted by the National Library of Medicine revealed a stark decline in African Savannah Elephants. Africa may have held over 20 million elephants before European colonization and 1 million as recently as the 1970s. The survey estimated a population of 352,271 savannah elephants across study sites in 18 countries, representing approximately 93% of all savannah elephants in those areas. Alarmingly, regions with historical data indicated a significant decline, estimating a decrease of 144,000 elephants between 2007 and 2014. Moreover, current data suggests a continent-wide decline of 8% per year in elephant populations, primarily attributed to poaching. During the 1970s and 1980s, a surge in poaching significantly reduced elephant populations in numerous regions. Moreover, a resurgence of poaching incidents since approximately 2005 has resulted in an alarming annual death toll, estimated at around 30,000 elephants recently.\nThis project aims to examine how elephant populations across Africa changed between 1995 and 2014. It involves using graphs and maps to show how the number of elephants varied over these years. To understand what might happen in the future, the project will use different mathematical methods to guess how many elephants there might be from 2015 to 2023.\nMoreover, this study will also look into whether there’s a connection between how many elephants there are and the trade of ivory. By comparing data about how many elephants there are with information about ivory trade, the project will try to find out if ivory trade affects the number of elephants.\nThe main goals are to see how elephant numbers changed over time, predict how many might exist in the coming years, and understand if the ivory trade has any impact on elephant populations. This research aims to help conservationists better understand and protect these majestic animals."

    "text": "Introduction\nThe African elephant(Loxodonta africana) aka The Gentle Giants, a keystone species crucial to the continent’s ecosystem, has faced significant population challenges over the decades due to various factors such as poaching, habitat loss, and human-wildlife conflicts. Understanding the historical trends in elephant populations is fundamental in formulating effective conservation strategies and policies. This project aims to comprehensively analyze the population dynamics of African elephants spanning from 1950 to 2015 by leveraging robust data visualization techniques and advanced statistical methods.\nUsing datasets sourced from reputable conservation organizations and wildlife databases, the project begins by visually mapping the fluctuations in elephant populations across different regions of Africa over the studied period. Subsequently, employing multiple regression methods, including but not limited to linear regression and time series analysis, the study intends to forecast the elephant population from 2016 to 2023 based on historical data trends.\nMoreover, in an effort to comprehend the potential correlation between the illegal ivory trade and elephant populations, the project incorporates ivory trade data alongside elephant population data-set. Through correlation analysis and visual representations, the study aims to discern any discernible patterns or connections between these variables, shedding light on whether the ivory trade has had an impact on the fluctuating populations of African elephants.\nBy combining data visualization techniques, statistical analyses, and exploration of the complex interplay between elephant populations and the ivory trade, this project endeavors to contribute valuable insights into the dynamics of African elephant conservation and the factors influencing their populations. Ultimately, the findings may aid policymakers, conservationists, and wildlife experts in formulating more targeted and effective measures to safeguard these majestic creatures and their habitats."

    "text": "Question 1:- How has elephant population varied over the years across several African countries?\n\nIntroduction\nElephants are the gentle giants and here we want to know about the trends in their population and to find out whether its declining or is at safe level, and if there is a decrease in their population then to find out the reason the cause. Understanding the population dynamics of African elephants is pivotal for conservation efforts and ecological balance. This will help us in safeguarding their future and to show to next many generations the gentle giants of this planet and how marvelous they are.\nThe dataset under examination spans from 1995 to 2014, presenting a valuable opportunity to predict and comprehend the trends in elephant populations for the subsequent years i.e. 2015 to 2023. This study aims to investigate the variations in elephants population across several African countries during the period, leveraging a multi-faceted analytical approach including data pre-processing, explanatory analysis, predictive modelling and country-level analysis\n\n\nApproach\nWe are going to make a code which serves as a robust approach for visualizing and analyzing the fluctuation in elephant population estimates across multiple years within several African countries. Using libraries such as ggplot2 and plotly, this methodology aggregates and processes elephant population data, offering a comprehensive depiction of population trends. We are going to initially read and preprocess the data-set, grouping data by year and summing up estimates, subsequently training an Ordinary Least Squares (OLS) regression model to predict population estimates for future years. Through visualization, we will make interactive plots, showcasing the historical trends of elephant populations from 1995 to 2015, while also projecting estimates for subsequent years i.e. from 2015 to 2023. The plots illustrate the trajectory of elephant population estimates, distinguishing between actual data and predicted values. By merging actual and forecasted population data, the code encapsulates a holistic view, enabling the viewer to comprehend the variations and potential trajectories of elephant populations across different African countries over time. These visualizations serve as an invaluable tool for understanding the historical trends and potential projections of elephant population changes, facilitating comprehensive insights into the population dynamics across various African regions.\n\n\nAnalysis"

This analysis aims to study ivory trade in Africa using available historical data. The dataset covers past ivory trade information and seeks to predict trends from 2020 to 2023. The main goal is to reveal how ivory trade has changed over time by using careful data processing, exploring data, making predictions and creating clear visualizations.\n\n\nApproach\nWe are going to conducts an analysis of ivory trade in Africa based on data from CITES. We read and processe the data-set to count the number of ivory exports per year from 1990 to 2022. It then visualizes this information using a bar plot, showcasing the trend of ivory exports over time. Additionally, it explores the types of ivory exports, displaying their counts through a bar plot. These visualizations enable the observation of trends in ivory trade, showcasing changes in export volumes over the years and providing insights into the types of ivory being traded.\nThe trend of ivory trade in Africa, as depicted by the analysis, showcases the fluctuation in export counts over the years from 1990 to 2022. It allows for a visual understanding of the general trajectory of ivory exports, indicating whether they have increased, decreased, or remained relatively stable over this period. Additionally, the analysis dives into the types of ivory exports, offering insights into the diversity or dominance of specific types in the trade, which contributes to understanding the overall trend of ivory trade in Africa."
